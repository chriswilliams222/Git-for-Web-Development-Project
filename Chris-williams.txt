    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

Ummm. The box model assigns a height and width for block element that can be manipulated by height/width, padding, border, and margin.
The fix is box sizing, resulting in the element contents not being effected in changes in height and width changes but allows the elements padding and border to be included in the total height and width.
